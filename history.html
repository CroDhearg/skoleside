            Before the Romans came, Britain was made up of different tribes with their own leaders. The tribes didn’t always get along. The Romans had heard about Britain since Julius Caesar’s time. In 55 and 54 BC, Caesar visited but didn’t take control. He learned about Britain’s resources and made some tribes pay him.

            After Caesar, the Romans had more contact with Britain. Some tribes, like the Atrebates, traded with Rome, while others, like the Catuvellauni, resisted. When Emperor Claudius became ruler in AD 41, he wanted to prove himself. He became emperor after Caligula was murdered. Claudius thought invading Britain would make him popular and bring riches to Rome.
            
            In AD 43, the Roman army, led by General Aulus Plautius, landed in Britain. Historians think they landed at Richborough or Chichester. The Romans fought the British tribes and won important battles. They took control of places like Colchester, the capital of the Catuvellauni.
            
            Claudius returned to Rome after 16 days. The Romans celebrated his victory and started building forts and roads in southern Britain. Over the next few years, they took control of more land, but it wasn’t until AD 85 that they controlled most of Britain.
