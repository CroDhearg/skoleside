            Before the Romans came, Britain was made up of different tribes with their own leaders. The tribes didn’t always get along. The Romans had heard about Britain since Julius Caesar’s time. In 55 and 54 BC, Caesar visited but didn’t take control. He learned about Britain’s resources and made some tribes pay him.

            After Caesar, the Romans had more contact with Britain. Some tribes, like the Atrebates, traded with Rome, while others, like the Catuvellauni, resisted. When Emperor Claudius became ruler in AD 41, he wanted to prove himself. He became emperor after Caligula was murdered. Claudius thought invading Britain would make him popular and bring riches to Rome.
            
            In AD 43, the Roman army, led by General Aulus Plautius, landed in Britain. Historians think they landed at Richborough or Chichester. The Romans fought the British tribes and won important battles. They took control of places like Colchester, the capital of the Catuvellauni.
            
            Claudius returned to Rome after 16 days. The Romans celebrated his victory and started building forts and roads in southern Britain. Over the next few years, they took control of more land, but it wasn’t until AD 85 that they controlled most of Britain.

The Normans had invaded England in 1066 and thereafter gradually advanced into Wales. William the Conqueror, now King of England, promptly put the border with Wales on a secure footing by establishing earldoms at Hereford and Chester. Thereafter, the Normans began an advance into southern Wales, establishing control over the likes of Pembroke and the Vale of Glamorgan.

In 1081, William led an army into Wales and reached St. David's, creating Cardiff. His son, King Henry I, continued the Norman expansion by encouraging settlers to come into Wales,and building the first royal castle in Carmarthen in 1109. Despite this, the Welsh princes resisted and reclaimed land once Henry I died in 1135.

In 1194 the Welsh united under Llewelyn the Great, Prince of Wales. He fought off invasions by the English and even captured Shrewsbury in 1215. However in 1272 Edward I came to the throne of England. Edward invaded Wales three times and defeated the Welsh army. Llewelyn was defeated in battle in 1282; his brother, Dafydd, was taken prisoner and executed in 1283. From that time forward, Wales was ruled by the English and made part of the English crown.
